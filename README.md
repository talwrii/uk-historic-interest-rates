This project seeks to create a collection of scrapers (to run under scraperwiki or similar) to collect interest
for most UK bank accounts. This should make it easy to inform consumers when it is worth switching 
banking products in the UK.

Economic Context
================

Websites are very good at collecting interest rates for accounts that you can open (see MoneySavingExport or money.co.uk), however several
banks seek to ensure that as few of their customers as possible have these accounts. Instead, they regularly create
a new type of account and make it impossible to open the old account. 

Two reasons for this are:
   * Market segmentation - there is a section of the public who want the best interest rates, and are willing to expend
effort getting them. By restricting when people can open accounts, but still offering very competitive rates they can
capture these customers, while still charging the less price-tolerant higher rates.
   * Actively trying to mislead customers about the rate that their bank is paying. Very few banks inform their
customers about rate changes, and they often make it quite unclear what bank account you actually have! For example
the post office bank has over 50 different quoted saving rates at the time of writing, they offer two or three types
of bank account.

This makes is difficult for investers to choose the best bank account.

How the project should work
===========================

The maintainer has limited time to invest on this project, and writing screen scrapers is often not the 
most educational of activities! The hope is that other people will write scrapers for other bank accounts 
as and when they need them, which they submit back to the project. (They will be incentivised to do this
if there are useful surrounding tools!).
